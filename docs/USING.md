# Using Caduceus for OM-3

This page is for **v0.26.2**, the latest version. Not installed yet? Start with [Install](INSTALL.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Caduceus works on the **COLOR** profiles (COLOR 1–4) and your **films** (FILM 1–20). The Monochrome profiles keep
> the camera's own settings.

## In one minute

- Turn the creative dial to **COLOR** and open **Picture Mode**. After COLOR 1–4 the list shows your films,
  **FILM 1–20**. Pick one: its name becomes the big title, and the shooting screen and viewfinder show it.
- Change anything on the rows below: the film changes at once, and so does live view.
- Your changes stay with that film, even after you switch the camera off.
- **Hold OK** on a film to put it back the way it was built.

## Choosing a film

1. Turn the creative dial to **COLOR**.
2. Open **Picture Mode** (from the super control panel or the menu).
3. The top row lists **COLOR 1–4, then FILM 1–20**. Turn to the film you want.

Your films load from the card by themselves a moment after the camera starts. The camera remembers the film you were on
when you switch it off.

What each of the 20 film sims looks like: [the film sims](../README.md#the-20-film-sims).

**Quicker:** on the super control panel, select the Picture Mode cell and turn a dial. It steps through COLOR 1–4, then
FILM 1–20.

## Changing a film

The rows under Picture Mode change the film (or the COLOR) you're on, straight away:

| Row | What it does |
|---|---|
| **HSL** | The colour wheel: change each colour's saturation, hue and brightness, and split toning (see below). |
| **Contrast** | The camera's own contrast. |
| **Highlight & Shadow** | The camera's own tone curve: brighter or darker shadows, midtones and highlights. |
| **Blk** / **Wht** | Blacks and Whites, −5 to +5. Plus lifts the blacks or brightens the whites; minus deepens or softens them. |
| **WB** | Shifts the colour balance: A–B (amber to blue) and G–M (green to magenta), −7 to +7. Works in every white balance mode, Auto included. Press **OK** to open the camera's own grid; **MENU** or **OK** brings you back. |
| **Sharpness** | −5 = off, −4 to −1 softer, 0 the camera's normal, +1 and +2 crisper. |
| **Noise Filter** | Off, Low, Std or High. |
| **Vignette Correction** | Off = the lens's natural darker corners. On = the camera corrects them. |
| **Shading** | Darker or lighter corners, as an effect. |
| **Glow** | +1 to +5 adds a soft glow. −1 to −5 adds Clarity (crisper local contrast). 0 = off. |
| **Film Grain** | Off, Low, Med or High. Added in colour, with no extra wait after the photo. |

## The colour wheel (HSL)

1. Go to the **HSL** row and press **INFO**.
2. Press **INFO** again to move through the pages: **Color** (saturation of one colour) → **Color All** → **Hue** →
   **Luminance** → **Shadows** → **Highlights** → back to Color.
3. On each page the **front dial** picks the colour and the **rear dial** sets the value.

The 12 colours run clockwise from Yellow at 12 o'clock: Yellow, Orange, Orange-red, Red, Magenta, Violet, Blue,
Blue-cyan, Cyan, Green-cyan, Green, Yellow-green.

- **Hue**, −5 to +5: plus turns a colour toward its clockwise neighbour (Yellow toward Orange).
- **Luminance**, −5 to +5: makes that colour darker or brighter.

**Split toning** uses the **Shadows** and **Highlights** pages. Each tints the dark or the bright parts of the photo
toward one colour. The front dial picks the colour, the rear dial the strength (−5 to +5; minus tints toward the
opposite colour; 0 = off). For a classic split tone, use both: for example blue shadows and orange highlights.

## Your changes are kept

- Change a film and the change stays: switch to another film and back, or switch the camera off and on, and it's
  still there. COLOR 1–4 keep their own changes the same way.
- Changes are saved to the card at the next half-press.
- A **`*`** after a name means it's changed: after FILM n, something differs from how the film was built; after
  COLOR n, something differs from the camera's factory settings. A row with its own `*` is one of the changes.

**To start over:**

- **Hold OK on a film** in the Picture Mode list: the film goes back to how it was built.
- **Hold OK on COLOR n:** that COLOR goes back to the camera's factory settings.

## New films from the Control Panel

The [Control Panel](https://androidfanman.github.io/caduceus-om3/) is a web page for making and changing films on your
computer, with a preview. It starts with the same 20 film sims.

1. Make or change your films in the Control Panel.
2. Save them as **`LOOKS.BIN`**, with *Firmware on the camera* set to **v0.26.1 or later**.
3. Copy `LOOKS.BIN` into the card's `OM3MOD` folder, replacing the old one.

A film you changed in the Control Panel starts again as you built it there; the other films keep the changes you made
on the camera. Deleting `OM3MOD/EDITS.BIN` puts every film back as built.

More on the Control Panel: [how to use it](CONTROL_PANEL.md).

## Reading the look from a photo

The camera writes the settings a JPG was shot with into the photo's XMP (`cad:` fields: film name, the three colour
wheels as 12-number lists, tone, white balance, Glow / Clarity, Art, NR, VigFix, Grain, Sharp, split toning; the
list is in `docs/FORMATS.md`, "XMP fields"). The Control Panel's **Look from photo** button adds that look to your
looks. To see the fields in exiftool by name:

```
exiftool -config docs/caduceus-xmp.config -XMP-cad:all photo.jpg
```

## Questions

See the [questions and answers](FAQ.md): no films in the list, settings that don't show in the photo, freezes, lost changes, video and more.

## The files on the card

All in the `OM3MOD` folder at the top of the card:

| File | What it is | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `LOOKS.BIN` | Your films FILM 1–20, with their names | The release or the Control Panel |
| `EDITS.BIN` | The changes you made on the camera | Written by the camera |
| `BUNDLES.BIN` | The camera's current values (`.NEW` and `.BAK` are its safety copies) | Written by the camera |
| `GUIDES.BIN` | Caduceus's code and labels | The release: always with its own firmware |
| `LABELS.BIN`, `TONES.BIN` | Labels, and the split toning guides | The release |

Older versions also used `NAMES.BIN`; it's harmless. Technical details: [FORMATS.md](FORMATS.md).
